# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

This is a Code of Conduct for TheModdersDen's GitHub projects. This is a living document and subject to change. Please check back regularly for updates. Last updated: May 1st, 2024.

### Purpose

The purpose of this Code of Conduct is to establish a standard of behavior for all members of TheModdersDen's GitHub projects. This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by TheModdersDen, including but not limited to GitHub repositories, Discord servers, YouTube channels, Twitch channels, social media accounts, game servers, and websites.

### Community Values

TheModdersDen's community is built on the following values:

#### Any of the following behavior is unacceptable

- Offensive comments related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, or background
- No swearing or vulgar language
- No extremely graphic or violent language
- No jokes that are based upon stereotypes or that are otherwise offensive
- No sexualized content or jokes
- No unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- No advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
- Repeatedly posting off-topic messages in a group
- Repeatedly sending unwanted direct messages to someone
- Continuing to post or talk about sensitive topics after being asked to stop
- Threats of violence
- Deliberate intimidation
- Sexually explicit or violent material
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Stalking or following
- Or any other kinds of harassment

Use your best judgement. If it will possibly make others uncomfortable, do not do it or post it.

Please also keep these values in mind when communicating with other members of the community as well as with the general public:

- **Be respectful.** Disagreement is not an opportunity to attack someone else's thoughts or opinions. Although views may differ, remember to approach every situation with patience and care.
- **Be considerate.** Think about how your contribution will affect others in the community.
- **Be open minded.** Embrace new people and new ideas. Our community is continually evolving and we welcome positive change. The only constant is change.
- **Be collaborative.** Work together! We can learn a lot from each other. Share knowledge, and help each other out.
- **Be inclusive!** TheModdersDen's communities are **NOT** echo chambers. I welcome people of all backgrounds and skill levels. We are all here to learn and grow together.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, I ask that you report it by contacting TheModdersDen via the contact page on my official site, here: [Contact TheModdersDen](https://themoddersden.com/contact/). Please include your name and a description of the incident, and I will get back to you ASAP.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, TheModdersDen's may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Coding Train spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other Coding Train members or the general public.

The following mitigations will be taken for violations of the Code of Conduct:

- **First Offense:** Warning
- **Second Offense:** Temporary Ban
- **Third Offense:** Permanent Ban
- **Fourth Offense:** Report to the proper authorities
- **Fifth Offense:** Prosecution to the fullest extent of the law
