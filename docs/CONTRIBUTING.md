# The WindowsGSM.Template Plugin Contributing Guide

## How to contribute to this project

### Getting Started

1. [Click the button at the top of this page that says "Use this template"](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).
2. [Name your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-new-repository). (I recommend naming it `WindowsGSM.GameType` or something similar, so you can easily find it later on. Replace `GameType` with the name of the game you're creating a plugin for.).

4. [Open the repository in your IDE or Text Editor](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository?tool=webui).
5. [Add your desired changes, modifications, and additions(this part is completely up to you!)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life).
6. [Commit your changes](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project).
7. [Push your initial changes to your repository, then use pull requests (It's the easiest way I've found to keep code clean)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests).
